# Deep-Cerulean

Deep Cerulean is a calm, soothing simulation depicting the nature of ocean life. Eels and manta rays float happily along the current. Sharks bicker amongst each other for hunting territory. Schools of fish fly by, sometimes chased by other sharks. Everything responds to another in this interconnected underwater landscape.

You can choose to watch the serene scene or participate yourself as the great white shark. Sightsee aquatic life first-hand and grab a bite to eat. Join fellow sharks in hunts, or eliminate the competition!
